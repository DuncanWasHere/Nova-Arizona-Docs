## Bio:

Alba Nox is a [[Frumentarii|Frumentarius]] located at the [[Solitare Big Stop]] in 2281. He is currently off-duty and can be found inside the [[Solitare Consulate]].

Recently, Alba Nox served as an advisor to [[Dominicus Rex|Dominicus Rexâ€™s]] execution spree following the [[Big-Stop-Uprising]].

Before the [[First-Battle-of-Hoover-Dam]], Alba Nox and other Frumentarii participated in the [[Legion-Infiltration-of-the-Divide|covert infiltration]] of the [[The Divide|Divide]], securing leadership positions in the community while a nearby force of Legionaries prepared to launch an offensive with the goal of capturing the settlement and cutting off NCR supply lines through the region. He had left the Divide to deliver a report to [[Caesar]] before its underground ICBMs were detonated, destroying the landscape and ghoulifying the soldiers trapped within the wreckage.

Like all Frumentarii, Alba Nox was provided with an advanced education at the [[Universitas Caesaris]], including lessons in pre-war history and [[Dissolute]] culture.

Alba Nox is a reasonable and well-spoken man.
