## Bio:

Aspirant Cassia is an Aspirant of the [[Cult of Mars]] assigned to the [[Solitare Big Stop]] in 2281.

Cassia is secretly a member of the [[Followers of the Apocalypse]], a doctor named Natalie, working undercover in an attempt to subvert [[Caesar's Legion|Legion]] pedagogy by sowing doubt in the children's ideological beliefs. So far, she has utterly failed at this, and instead has been forced to genuinely assist in raising the children to be [[Legionaries]].

Cassia struggles with maintaining her cover and betrayal of the Hippocratic Oath. Her blind (nearly fanatical) optimism and belief in making the world a better place, have since withered during her time in the Legion.
