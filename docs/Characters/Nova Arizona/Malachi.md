## Bio:

Malachi is a slaver visiting the [[Malpais Market]] in 2281.

Self-made businessman and head of a mysterious slavery ring based out of Two Sun. Currently in Malpais to deliver a shipment of slaves. Very “used car salesman” kind of guy. Prodding will reveal that he’s able to supply so many slaves because his operation is basically chattel slavery, which the Legion looks down upon.
