## Bio:

Cal, full name Bill Calhoun, is a former member of the [[Followers of the Apocalypse]] and [[Support Unit Hoover]], and current community leader of [[Haven|Hideaway]] in 2281. He can be found bartending in [[The Velvet Ditch]].

Having been on the expedition to the [[Magnum Chasma|Grand Canyon]] alongside [[Joshua Graham]] and [[Caesar|Edward Sallow]], Cal has lived a long and interesting life as a consequence of the guilt he acquired for failing to stop Caesar when he had the chance. Cal has spent decades of his life fighting [[Caesar's Legion]], though the man himself had totally forgotten him decades  ago.

Cal is a Follower, a doctor, a Ranger, a hero, a coward, an ambassador, a trainer, a spiritual leader, a bartender, and a failure. He has gone by many names: William, Bill, Billy, The Mad Prophet, and He Who Watched. Throughout all of them he has been crushed by failure after failure, including the destruction of the [[Tall Pines]] and [[Desert Rangers]].
