## Bio:

Antoninus is a Recruit [[Legionaries|Legionary]] posted at the [[Hoover Dam Rest Stop]] in 2281.

Antoninus is considerably young, with practically no combat experience. Yet he still holds an overwhelming belief that the [[Caesar's Legion|Legion]] will bring civilization to the Wasteland.

Antoninus was recently assigned to the post by his Centurion, whom he had annoyed by correcting the Centurion's usage of the label [[Degenerates|"degenerate"]] to describe a [[Profligates|Profligate]].

Antoninus is currently under the direct command of [[Publius Veranus]].
