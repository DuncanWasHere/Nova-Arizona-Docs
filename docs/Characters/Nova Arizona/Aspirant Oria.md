## Bio:

Aspirant Oria is an Aspirant of the [[Cult of Mars]] assigned to [[Newt]] in 2281.

Oria is a young, somewhat opportunistic careerist, single-mindedly focused on espousing the Cult's values, converting the children of Newt to the Legion ideology, and ensuring that the women "know their place."
