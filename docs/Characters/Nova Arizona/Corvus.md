## Bio:

Corvus is a captive [[Frumentarii|Frumentarius]] being held prisoner in [[Haven|Hideaway]] in 2281.

Corvus was captured by [[Wierzbowski]] after the Frumentarius accidentally discovered the physical location of Hideaway while investigating the cause of the [[Chainway-Collapse]]. Wierzbowski decided to spare his life in hopes that he could be deprogrammed.
