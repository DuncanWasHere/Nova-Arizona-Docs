## Bio:

Centurion Aetius is the commander of the [[Mojave Orientum]] [[Caesar's Legion|Legion]] garrison, stationed in [[Chloride]] in 2281. He can be found inside the [[Chloride Consulate]].

Aetius reports directly to [[Proconsul Aristophontes]].

Aetius is one of the few actual Legionaries in town. He obviously harbors deep resentment over the nature of his post but holds his tongue and refuses to say much about anything. If persistently questioned about the deputies, he repeats verbatim Aristophontesâ€™s hidden motive for having them: keeping the local troublemakers busy and placating them with faux positions of authority, which also intimidates the common rabble.
