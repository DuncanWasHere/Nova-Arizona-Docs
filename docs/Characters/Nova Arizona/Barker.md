## Bio:

Barker is an ex-[[Desert Rangers|Desert Ranger]] and former member of [[Support Unit Hoover]] hiding out in [[Elephant Hill Cave]] in 2281. 

Barker has heavily booby-trapped the cave with explosives, and is extremely suspicious of anyone who encounters him.

Barker participated in the Desert Rangers' war against [[Caesar's Legion]], already a seasoned and respected veteran by the time it began in 2264. He was among those who opposed [[Ranger-Unification-Treaty|unification]] with the [[New California Republic Rangers|NCR Rangers]] in 2271, predicting that the [[New California Republic|NCR]] would abuse the chain of command to shuffle manpower away from the Legion front to pursue their own interests elsewhere, effectively handing Arizona over to the Legion which they saw as a problem to be dealt with later. 

After the treaty was ratified, Barker helped found Support Unit Hoover, a local resistance group comprised of civilians, militiamen, tribals, and other Desert Rangers dedicated to stopping the Legion's advance at all costs.

Predictably then, when the NCR ordered a complete withdrawal from Arizona in 2276, Barker went AWOL and renounced his NCR citizenship, then, along with the other members of Support Unit Hoover, sought refuge underground in what would become known as [[Haven|Hideaway]].

Brewing resentment stemming from disagreements over the risks associated with participating in active rebellion against the Legion eventually culminated in [[Niemann]] and [[The Hermit|Sherman]] leaving Hideaway in 2280. When Barker failed to convince the others to support the [[Big-Stop-Uprising]], he too finally left Hideaway in September 2281, effectively resulting in the disbandment of Support Unit Hoover.
