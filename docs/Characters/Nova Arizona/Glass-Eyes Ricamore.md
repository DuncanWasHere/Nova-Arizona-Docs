## Bio:

Glass-Eyes Ricamore is a ghoul bartender who runs [[Elephant Hill]] in 2281. He can be found inside [[The Elephant's Foot Saloon]].

Ricamore is an old pre-war ghoul who worked at the saloon and as a tour guide for the [[Sunset Sarsaparilla Company]] before the [[Great-War]]. He went blind in both eyes due to being poisoned by methanol while distilling his own liquor.

Ricamore despises war and bloodshed, yet still maintains a good under-the-table relationship with [[Proconsul Aristophontes]] and the [[Mojave Orientum]] shareholder merchants.
