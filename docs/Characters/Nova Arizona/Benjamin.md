## Bio:

Benjamin is a former scout for the [[Desert Rangers]] and ex-member of [[Support Unit Hoover]], located in [[Haven|Hideaway]] in 2281. He can be found inside [[The Velvet Ditch]]. 

Benjamin now utilizes his reconnaissance skills to serve as a supply runner for Haven.

Benjamin firmly believes that the [[New California Republic|NCR]] will soon return to the region and save them from the [[Caesar's Legion|Legion]]. 

Benjamin was born and raised in the [[Snake Mountains]] in northern Nevada, where he grew up speaking German along with his family. As a result. he has retained a light German accent and sometimes calls Hideaway “Freihafen.”

After having a falling out with his family, Benjamin left the Snake Mountains to live with his uncle in [[Peach Springs]]. When he died, Benjamin took over his business working alongside a [[Tall Pines]] caravan company, which eventually led to him meeting and marrying a merchant woman named Marguerite, who died giving birth to their daughter [[Serwa]].

Near the end of the Arizona Rangers' war with the Legion, Benjamin and Serwa took shelter in [[Haven|Hideaway]], expecting NCR reinforcements to eventually return.

Benjamin was recently wounded by [[Veteran Autonous]] and has since been stuck in Hideaway for several weeks while he recovers.
