## Bio:

Jem is a merchant living in the [[Solitare Big Stop]] in 2281. She can be found working inside [[Jem's Goods and Services]].

Early 30s, oddly chipper and upbeat merchant. Came down to Nevada from ??? looking for an adventure as a wandering merchant. Followed the NCR after overhearing a patrol route to Arizona, then reached Big Stop once the Legion had already regained control. They permit her to run a store in exchange for a steady supply of goods. Provides information about [[Marcellus Sedonus]] accepting chems if the player passes an 80 Speech check. Requires the player to wait until a certain time period (i.e. 9PM) for the guard Legionnaire to leave the interior Jem is located in before she vaguely whispers this information to you (she simply says speak to him saying she sent you). Triggers his quest line. Otherwise she would provide NCR and Legion Big Stop conflict lore as well as being a functioning merchant.
