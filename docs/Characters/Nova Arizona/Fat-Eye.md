## Bio:

Fat-Eye is a chem dealer for the [[Kingman Outfit]] staying at [[Elephant Hill]] in 2281. He can be found inside [[The Elephant's Foot Saloon]].

Fat-Eye is named after his tendency to get into fights while high and or drunk wherein he often catches a black eye he is mainly a chem dealer who hides his true intentions/skirts the Legion by not technically selling chems but instead the chemical ingredients to make them (which he also does himself). Could be convinced to offer his services to you but on the other hand, maybe the Legion has a use for those chems.
