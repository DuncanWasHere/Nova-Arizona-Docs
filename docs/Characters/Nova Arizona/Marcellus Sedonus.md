## Bio:

Marcellus Sedonus is a [[Legionaries|Legionary]] Legatus in command of [[Legio II]] and the [[Malpais Legionary Camp]] in 2281.

Second legate of the Legion. Involved in a campaign in Sedona, for he earned his cognomen. Former Buffout addict with a Sunset Sasparilla addiction and a nasty temper. Is good but not great at logistics, and is perceived as personally incompetent (read: not an inspiring leader) by numerous Legionaries. Involved in almost all Malpais quests, as whether he stays in power will determine the outcome of many of them.
