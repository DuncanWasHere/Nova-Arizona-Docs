## Bio:

Omar is a trader stranded at [[Hoover's Hope Refugee Camp]] in 2281.

He provides a negative view of the NCR because they won’t let him cross the dam, and refuse to do anything to help the refugees. One soldier even warned that they’d gun down any refugees trying to get through, out of security concerns. Now Omar doles out his dwindling supplies to the other refugees, waiting for something to give.
