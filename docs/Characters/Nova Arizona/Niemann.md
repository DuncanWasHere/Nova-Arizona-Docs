## Bio:

Niemann is a former member of [[Support Unit Hoover]] and current leader of the [[Tipton Gang]] hiding out in [[Mount Tipton Cave]] in 2281.

Was a medic and an idealist. The failure of the NCR to advance past Big Stop angered him to the point of leaving SUH. Traveled down south and took part in the cartel wars in Gadsden for control of supply routes along the Colorado. Formed his own cartel with the goal of undermining the Legion through the drug trade. Has returned north to take advantage of the [[Chainway-Collapse|collapse of the Chainway]].
