Haven, also known as Hideaway, a Safe Place, Easytown, or Moletown, is an underground, highly secretive community of insurgents and subversives who have collectively sought refuge from the Legion's oppressive rule.

Haven exists within an abandoned pre-war mine near the equally deserted ruins of [[White Hills]], a company town that housed miners before the Great War. Many of those miners, radicalized by terrible working conditions, meager pay, and a federal ban on labor unions for all "critical" industries, had also been using the mine as a secret meeting place for resistance planning two centuries prior. The mine itself was decommissioned in the 2060s.
